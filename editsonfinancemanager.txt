EDITS ON FINANCE MANAGER
-balance is not reflecting on the budget side like home page
-transaction db is not working
-work on UI
-the transaction and saving tables should show transactions made...not necessarily a graph
-in budget menu, remove the enter your name n put enter name of transaction ama put options instead just like in transactions
-in add transaction add options for transaction type
-also add categories ama just do away with it 
-on savings you have not put an option to add savings to an already present saving
-cannot add savings on the savings dashaboard and also the table is not reflecting the current saving added
-amount is only reflecting on home page so work on that
-also make it so that only one tab opens at a time..cause i see that other than when i don't completely log out of the system all the tabs can be open at the same time..poor 
-but the system is amazing...let's make it best sasa
